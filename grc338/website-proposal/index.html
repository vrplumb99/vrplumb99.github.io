					<h1> Our Story </h1>
				
                <p> [Trio of women smiling.] </p>
                
					<p>    Dainty Designs is owned and operated by three local designers: Claire Edwards, Laura James, and Danny Jacobs. Claire specializes in jewelry and metal design. Laura has been a graphic designer for over 15 years. Danny has a background in painting and sculpting. How did this partnership come to be? </p>

                <p>Claire started Dainty Designs in 2004. In 2008, Claire needed help attracting more customers and making a more welcoming atmosphere for inside the boutique. So, she hired Laura as a freelance graphic designer and contracted Danny as a landscape painter. The trio worked well together,and Claire couldnâ€™t help but notice the great taste in jewelry Laura and Danny wore. She decided to do an experiment and see how they would do designing jewelry with her. </p>
                
                <p>In 2018, they celebrated a decade of partnership! Together, each of them brings a different perspective to the art of jewelry design.</p>

                <p>Our Vision</p>
